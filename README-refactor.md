# Detection Pipeline Multi-Threading Refactor

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the `DetectionPipeline` from a single-threaded to a multi-threaded architecture to improve performance by separating CPU-bound data loading operations from GPU-bound inference operations.

## Current Architecture

### Single-Threaded Pipeline
```
Data Loading ‚Üí Detection ‚Üí Post-processing
     ‚Üì            ‚Üì            ‚Üì
   Sequential ‚Üí Sequential ‚Üí Sequential
```

**Bottleneck**: GPU inference waits for CPU-bound data loading operations, leading to poor GPU utilization.

## Target Architecture

### Multi-Threaded Pipeline
```
Data Loading Thread (Producer)    Detection Thread (Consumer)
        ‚Üì                                ‚Üì
   CPU-bound operations           GPU-bound operations
   - Image file reading          - Model inference
   - Tile creation              - ROI post-processing
   - Tensor conversion          - Result processing
   - Batch preparation          - Progress tracking
        ‚Üì                                ‚Üì
   [Thread-Safe Queue] ‚Üê‚Üí [Thread-Safe Queue]
```

## Technical Considerations

### Windows Compatibility
- Use `threading` instead of `multiprocessing` (Windows limitation)
- Ensure proper thread cleanup on Windows

### Memory Management
- Bounded queues to prevent memory overflow
- Monitor queue sizes and adjust dynamically
- Implement proper resource cleanup

### Error Handling
- Robust error handling for both threads
- Graceful degradation when errors occur
- Proper error propagation between threads

### Performance Metrics
- GPU utilization improvement
- Throughput (images/second)
- Memory usage patterns
- Queue utilization statistics

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests ‚úÖ
- [x] Thread safety tests for queues
- [x] Error handling tests
- [x] Memory leak tests
- [x] Performance regression tests

### Integration Tests ‚úÖ
- [x] End-to-end pipeline tests

- [x] Multi-threaded pipeline integration tests
- [x] Configuration validation tests

### Performance Tests
- [ ] GPU utilization benchmarks
- [ ] Throughput comparison (single vs. multi-threaded)
- [ ] Memory usage profiling

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during implementation:
1. Keep the original single-threaded implementation as fallback
2. Add configuration flag to switch between implementations
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
4. Gradual rollout with feature flags

## Success Criteria
